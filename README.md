# FAQ
- How often are updates?
    - Mostly they'll be posted through the week, as I work long hours on the weekend. Each update will probably have a test phase before I push it to the live branch. 
- How often does this API refresh?
    - Spotify limits the refresh to 1 hour. This app automatically refreshes the token needed.
